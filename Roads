Roads
-----

I know I live on a road, 
and I think that you do too
They're the places we call home
At least on our commute.

there are alleyways and highways
but the one thing they all do
is get you where you're going from
to where you're going to.

Roaaaaaaaadds

they're called many types of things
like streets lanes and and avenues
but when you've gone across them all
it's the same thing that takes you through

we have some short ones and some long
some in the middle too
some curve and some are arrow straight
some bumpy and some are very smooth

Rooooooooaddddsss

let's name some roads because we know them so
states st and potrero
